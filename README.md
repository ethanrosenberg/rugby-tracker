This app allows you to signup as a coach and easily manage your entire player roster for your rugby team.

## Installation & Usage

To use this app, just clone and run

```

and then run

```

Enter the host url displayed (eg. http://178.128.13.85:56117) into your web browser to get started!

The first step will be to signup for a new user account using an email and password. After signup go ahead and login to start adding players to your roster.
